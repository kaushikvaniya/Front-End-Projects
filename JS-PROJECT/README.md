# Title: ðŸŒŸ JavaScript Project Collection: Calculator, Calendar, Weather App, Stopwatch etc.

### `Description`

This JavaScript project collection comprises four standalone applications: a calculator, a calendar, a weather app, and a stopwatch. Each application serves a different purpose, demonstrating various JavaScript functionalities and providing practical utilities for users.

### `Calculator:`

â€¢ The calculator application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

â€¢ Features include a user-friendly interface with buttons for numerical input and operation selection, as well as a display area to view the calculated result.

â€¢ JavaScript functions handle the logic for performing the mathematical calculations based on user inputs.

### `Calculator:`

â€¢ The calendar application provides users with a graphical representation of dates, days, and months.

### `Weather App:`

â€¢ The weather application fetches weather data from an external API and presents it to users in a user-friendly format.
